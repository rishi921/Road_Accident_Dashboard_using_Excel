# Road_Accident_Dashboard_using_Excel

Greeting's to everyone!
"Presenting my meticulously crafted Road Accident Dashboard of India, a data-driven visualization masterpiece that sheds light on the road casualities of our nation. ðŸš¦ðŸ“ŠðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

Using the power of MS Excel and leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, I have painstakingly transformed raw accident data into an intuitive and visually captivating dashboard.

I have taken data from Kaggle and its a demo data not a real data. It's a completely manipulated data not taken from any government website. It serves as a powerful tool for decision-makers, policymakers, and stakeholders to analyze accident patterns, identify hotspots, and develop targeted interventions to save lives and prevent injuries.

The project focuses on classifying the data into using various procedures that are required for analyzing data using various charts present in this dashboard. Throughout the project I have learned many Excel tricks which are required to be a Data and Business Analyst.

Aim of the project: To create a Road Accident Dashboard for the year 2021 & 2022 to get the insights of Monthly trend, Casualities with respect to vehicle type, Maximum Casualities by Road Type, Relation between casualities by Rural or Urban area by Day/Night.

Various steps included while creating a dashboard are as follows:
(i) Requirement Gathering
(ii) Data Cleaning
(iii) Data Processing
(iv) Data Analysis
(v) Data Visualization
